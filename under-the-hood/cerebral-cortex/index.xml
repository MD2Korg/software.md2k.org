      <description>Docker Cerebral Cortex is built for development and production use based on Docker technologies.
Container customizations and relevant docker-compose files are available in our GitHub repository. This repository contains configurations relevant for both development and production usage. As support is expanded for other cloud services, the GitHub page will reflect these additions.
Installation Two things must be installed to utilize these Docker containers:
 Docker Docker-compose  Once these dependencies have been installed, the commands on this page will function properly.</description>

      <description>To achieve our goal of high-rate streaming data collection, logging, real-time processing, and intervention, we built a flexible, layered architecture.
  Architecture Overview  mCerebrum overview illustrating how high-frequency data, 800&amp;#43; Hz, is processed and includes components for real-time data quality assessment, privacy, model evaluation, biomarker computation, and triggered user engagement.   mCerebrum supports high-frequency raw sensor data collection in excess of 800 Hz or 70+ million samples/day, along with their curation, analysis, storage (2GB/day), and secure uploads to a cloud platform.</description>

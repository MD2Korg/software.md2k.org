description: "This study examines smoking cessation in a population of African American smokers who are attempting to quit. Racial minority groups experience disparately
high levels of smoking and smoking-related morbidity and mortality than do white smokers. However, research is limited in the mechanisms of how smoking cessation and
this population interact. Evidence from this study will inform the tailoring of policies and interventions targeted at reducing the profound smoking-related disparities
experienced by the African American population. This study is guided by an overarching conceptual framework derived from models of the social determinants of health,
social cognitive theories, and previous empirical findings. Participants will be assessed using real-time, field-based, state of the science methodologies consisting of
mobile physiological sensing, ecological momentary assessment (EMA), and geographic positioning system (GPS). This study is designed to examine how demographics, social
history, contextual and environmental influences, biobehavioral/psychosocial predispositions, and acute momentary precipitants are associated with smoking lapse and
abstinence among 300 African American smokers attempting to quit."

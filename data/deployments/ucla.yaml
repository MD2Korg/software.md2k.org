description: "– This three-stage project is designed to assess oral health behaviors via mHealth technologies. In stage 1, we will develop the
Remote Oral Behaviors Assessment System (ROBAS) by integrating a multimodal sensing platform (smart toothbrush and wrist sensors) with the
mCerebrum software platform (physiological and EMA data logging, transmission, and activity/behavior inference system) for the testing and
iterative refinement via laboratory simulators and test subjects. In stage 2, ROBAS will be pilot tested in healthy subjects to optimize its
performance and usability in naturalistic settings across objective (precision, validity, reliability), subjective (user satisfaction, acceptability),
and user performance (amount of missing data) parameters. In stage 3, we will employ a randomized, controlled, crossover study to examine at-risk
(substance using) individuals with sociodemographically comparable control subjects to evaluate ROBAS’s capacity for longitudinal assessment of oral
health behaviors in naturalistic settings and verify its clinical utility and incremental validity over traditional self-reports. The associations
between sociobehavioral determinants, oral health behaviors (as assessed via self-reports and ROBAS), and dental disease indicators (gingivitis and
dental plaque) will be investigated across subjects with different levels of risk."

description: "This study examines the influence of socioeconomic status, social history, contextual and environmental influences, biobehavioral/psychosocial
predispositions, and acute momentary precipitants on stress, smoking lapse, and abstinence among 300 smokers attempting to quit. Additionally, this study
will examine 75 Sexual and Gender Minorities to supplant gaps in empirical evidence concerning the key sources of health disparities found in this population.
Evidence from this study will inform the tailoring of policies and interventions targeted at reducing the profound smoking-related disparities experienced
by individuals with low socioeconomic status and sexual and gender minorities. This study is guided by an overarching conceptual framework derived from models
of the social determinants of health, social cognitive theories, and previous empirical findings. Participants will be assessed using real-time, field-based,
state of the science methodologies consisting of mobile physiological sensing, ecological momentary assessment (EMA), and geographic positioning system (GPS)."

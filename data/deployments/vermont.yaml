description: "This study examines the multiple neurocognitive processes that have previously been implicated in relapse among smokers who are both
successful and unsuccessful in maintaining smoking abstinence. A neuroimaging battery will be employed that assesses the brainâ€™s cognitive control,
reward impulsivity, and stress/anxiety systems and will be complimented by mobile physiological sensing and ecological momentary assessment. Data
from this study will be used to conduct an assessment of the brain changes that the literature suggests occur early in abstinence and might determine
long-term abstinence via the combination of neuroimaging, phenotypic, physiologic, and environmental/contextual measures."

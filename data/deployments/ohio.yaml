description: "This study is
designed to evaluate the efficacy of the novel EasySense wireless, contactless system in
assessing pulmonary congestion via measurements of thoracic impedance and cardiac and lung
motion in patients with congestive heart failure (CHF) during hospitalization and post-discharge.
Patients will also be assessed for diuretic medication adherence using a suite of smartphone
applications, called mCerebrum. In addition, we will seek to evaluate patient-reported outcomes
related to quality of life, participation satisfaction, and will assess other measurements of
functional physical health using wearable wristband sensors and wireless blood pressure and
weight scale devices."

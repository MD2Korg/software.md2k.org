description: "This study has been
designed (1) to develop the decision rules and evaluate the feasibility of a just-in-time
intervention to delay or prevent smoking relapse in smokers attempting to quit (2) to predict
the timing of lapses following a quit attempt (3) to develop a model to detect smoking puffs and
episodes of smoking using wrist-worn inertial sensors (4) to develop a model of eating detection
using wrist-worn inertial sensors."

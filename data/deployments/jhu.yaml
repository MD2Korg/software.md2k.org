description: "â€¢	This study is designed to extend previous work in the development of methods to automatically detect the timing of cocaine use
from cardiac interbeat interval and physical activity data derived from wearable, unobtrusive mobile sensor technologies. This study will examine
under which conditions high quality continuous interbeat interval data and physical activity data can be obtained from a specially developed
smartwatch device in the natural field setting among a population of cocaine users. In addition to identifying common failure scenarios and
understanding wearability/usage patterns when collecting interbeat interval from smartwatches, this study will extend our previous work in the
detection of cocaine use via interbeat interval and physical activity data that were previously obtained via wearable chestband sensors. Information
from this study will contribute toward the adaptation of our existing computational model for detecting cocaine for use in wearable, less obtrusive
smartwatch devices."

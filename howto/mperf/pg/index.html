<h2 id="wrist-sensors">Wrist Sensors</h2>


<figure>
    
        <img src="/img/howto/MotionSenseHRV.png" />
    
    
    <figcaption>
        <h4>Motionsense HRV Wrist Sensor</h4>
        
    </figcaption>
    
</figure>


<ul>
<li>These wrist sensors are very much like smart watches or FitBits. (You may still wear a FitBit or other activity trackers or watches alongside the study-provided sensors.)</li>
<li>These wrist sensors gather data from your wrist/arm movements and transmit it via Bluetooth to the cell phone.</li>
<li>If the wrist sensor is malfunctioning, please contact the Field Manager to get a replacement as soon as possible. One wrist sensor will be replaced if it is damaged or lost. However, if you lose or break a subsequent wrist sensor or lose or break both wrist sensors, you will be withdrawn from the study. In the event of lost, stolen, or broken device(s), you will not be held financially liable.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="android-smartphone">Android Smartphone</h2>


<figure>
    
        <img src="/img/howto/mCerebrumOnPhone.png" />
    
    
    <figcaption>
        <h4>Phone Sensors</h4>
        
    </figcaption>
    
</figure>


<ul>
<li>The cell phone is a fully-functional Android phone which operates generally as any other smartphone.  The phone has been set up with study apps and allows it to collect all data measured from the sensors via Bluetooth and store it.  Intermittently, the phone transmits this data to the databank (back-end computational hardware) at the University of Memphis.</li>
<li>The study apps also collect phone usage data such as number and types of apps used; number and length of calls made/received; amount of web browsing/usage.  However, the phone does not record conversations or identify who calls are made to/from.</li>
<li>The cell phone app will also extract audio features, like ambient noise level in terms of decibels (dB), presence of human voices, or tone/pitch of conversation. Other audio features may also be extracted, but only information that is non-identifiable about the noises and conversations around you will be measured.</li>
<li>In case you wish to have privacy, you can turn off the data collection of the devices (including phone apps, wrist sensors and chest sensor). The data collection will resume after two hours unless you turn on the privacy mode again.</li>
<li>If your smart phone is malfunctioning, please contact the Field Manager to seek assistance. If you lose or break the study smartphone, you will be withdrawn from the study as key data collection will not be able to continue. In the event of a lost, stolen, or broken phone, you will not be held financially liable.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="chest-sensor-optional">Chest Sensor (optional)</h2>


<figure>
    
        <img src="/img/howto/mPerf/AutoSenseChest.png" />
    
    
    <figcaption>
        <h4>Autosense Chest Sensor</h4>
        
    </figcaption>
    
</figure>


<ul>
<li>You may be asked to wear a chest sensor for one week during the study.</li>
<li>The chest sensor records heart rate and infers respiration rhythm data and speed from by monitoring chest movement.</li>
<li>If the chest sensor is malfunctioning, please contact the Field Manager to get a replacement as soon as possible. If you lose or break the chest sensor, you will be not able to participate in this optional section of the study. In the event of a lost, stolen, or broken device, you will not be held financially liable.</li>
<li>The blue chest band has a buckle that snaps together and holds it to your chest. It can be adjusted to fit your body for a pretty snug fit. To the immediate left and right of the buckle you should see two black holes where the black wires of chest mote connect.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="location-tags-beacons">Location Tags/Beacons</h2>


<figure>
    
        <img src="/img/howto/mPerf/beacon.png" />
    
    
    <figcaption>
        <h4>Location Tag/Beacon</h4>
        
    </figcaption>
    
</figure>


<ul>
<li>You will be given a number of beacons that use Bluetooth to connect to the study’s apps. Depending on the kind of job you have (i.e., have more than one place where you work, or are usually in one place), you will likely be given two or three beacons.</li>
<li>These beacons will let us know how much time you spend in certain locations.</li>
<li>Place these beacons in all of your work locations, including home and office. Place them on the surface (desk or table) in your most common working environment(s). Keep them there for the duration of your participation in the study.</li>
<li>One location tag / beacon will be replaced if it is damaged or lost. However, if you lose or break more than one beacon, you will be continue your participation without the location tag/beacon. In the event of lost, stolen, or broken beacon(s), you will not be held financially liable.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="wrist-sensors-1">Wrist Sensors</h2>

<p>Put the Motionsense wrist sensors on as you would wear a watch or FitBit. The sensor should be oriented with the buckle on the strap going over the top of your wrist as shown.</p>

<h4 id="troubleshooting">Troubleshooting</h4>

<iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/2n7HwLWlgtQ" width="280" height="157" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe>

<p>If you are experiencing poor data quality:</p>

<ul>
<li>Reset the application, wait 15 seconds and check again.</li>
<li>Restart the phone, wait one minute and check again.</li>
<li>Make sure the wrist sensor is charged.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="important-information-regarding-the-devices">IMPORTANT INFORMATION REGARDING THE DEVICES</h2>

<ul>
<li>You may experience slight initial discomfort while wearing the sensors, such as minor skin irritations. However, the chest and wrist sensors have been used in multiple field studies, and no significant skin irritation has been reported. If you experience irritation which persists to a point where you no longer wish to participate, remove the sensors and contact the Field Manager.  The irritation is entirely reversible once the sensors are removed.</li>
<li>As with any electrical device, the sensors can theoretically cause electric shocks. Electrical shocks can be a health concern with certain health conditions (e.g., heart conditions that require a pacemaker). However, the probability of experiencing even minor electrical shocks is negligible. High impedance circuitry is used to limit current flow, even in the case of external events (e.g., through physical breaking of the sensor board or shorting of the battery leads). These devices been used in several previously completed studies on different populations; no adverse events have been reported or observed from the use or wearing of them.</li>
<li>All sensors in the wrist sensor (wristbands) devices are commonly used in mobile phone and other activity monitors and pose minimal risks.  Previous studies with the wrist sensors (wristbands) have indicated that after a brief adjustment period, the majority of participants adjusted to wearing the wrist sensors and did not find them to be intrusive or restraining.</li>
<li>Location data (GPS) collected from the participants has the risk of identifying the participant by depicting his/her exact location at a given time during the study. These data will also depict every location the participant has been, which may be potentially embarrassing if revealed. However, these data will be kept secure using best practices in data security. Moreover, access to these data will be restricted to authorized investigators and study staff who have IRB approval, have completed training in human subjects protection, and have agreed to uphold the privacy of participants in this study.</li>
<li>The cell phone provided to you is your cell phone to keep and use as you normally would, both during and after this study. During the study, you will use the phone to engage in study activities (like filling out surveys), but these surveys and sensor data collection will end after the study is over. If your phone or the sensors are damaged, lost or stolen, we will not be able to replace it, and your participation in the study may end early.  If your phone is lost or stolen, all of the data on it (including any personal application, contacts, messages, or other data) could be compromised. If the phone is lost or stolen during the study period, your study data stored on the phone may be compromised. <strong>For these reasons, we strongly recommend that you at least secure your phone with a strong lock screen password or fingerprint.</strong>  Your study data are secured on our back-end computational hardware with best practices in data security via encryption, firewall, password protection, and physical security. Our research partners will have access to your data via limited access accounts where each individual is explicitly granted access only to the datasets for which they are authorized.  Your name, workplace, or other personal information is not stored with the data collected by the devices or with the survey data.</li>

#### <a name="wristsensors"></a>Wrist Sensors

Each participant should wear the wrist sensors for an average of 8 hours a day. The sensors should be worn like a watch on each arm with the charging port pointed away from the hand as shown. The buckle is marked L or R to indicate left wrist or right wrist.

<img src="/img/howto/mPerf/MSHRVwearingL.png">

<img src="/img/howto/mPerf/MSHRVwearingR.png">


#### <a name="smartphone"></a>Smartphone

<img src="/img/howto/mPerf/SamsungS8.png">

Each participant should carry their phone with them each day and keep the phone charged and powered on. There is an extra charging cable provided in the suite so the participant can have one charging cable at work and one at home.


#### <a name="beacons"></a>Location Beacons

To power the beacons on/off, press down on the top of the beacon like a button. You will see a green LED light flash to indicate power is ON or a red LED light flash to indicate power is OFF. Please ensure the beacons are powered ON before giving them to participants.

<img src="/img/howto/mPerf/Beacon2.png">

The beacon labelled **W** should be placed in the participant's workplace. The beacon labelled **H** should be placed in the participant's home office (or wherever they are most likely to be working at home).

Once the beacons are set in place, they can stay powered ON and remain untouched for the duration of the study. The expected battery life is 3 to 6 months.

#### <a name="chest1"></a>Chest Belt (optional)

#### How to Use

The chest belt records respiration data by monitoring chest movement. The blue chest band has a buckle that snaps together and holds it to your chest. It can be adjusted to fit your body for a pretty snug fit.

<img src="/img/howto/mPerf/AutoSenseBLEchest.png">

To the immediate left and right of the buckle you should see two black ports where the black cables can be plugged in. Position the belt so that the buckle is at the front of your chest and the cables face down towards your feet as shown above.

The other end of the cable should be inserted into the outer-most port on the device. The other port will not be used.

<img src="/img/howto/mPerf/ASBLEplugRIP.png">

#### Troubleshooting

If you are experiencing poor data quality:

- In the menu, tap Reset Application, wait 15 seconds and check again.
- Restart the phone, wait one minute and check again.
- Make sure the wrist sensor is charged.

## <a name="charge"></a>How to Charge the Hardware

*Wrist sensors* should be charged overnight each day. The expected battery life is approximately 24 hours with a full charge.  

*Location beacons* are battery-powered and do not require charging. The expected battery like is 3-6 months.

*Smartphones* should be charged overnight each day and throughout the day as needed.

*Chest bands (optional)* should be charged overnight each day. The expected battery life is approximately 24 hours with a full charge.

## <a name="clean"></a>How to Clean the Hardware

*Wrist sensors* and *location beacons* can be cleaned gently by hand using disinfecting wipes. DO NOT submerge the devices in water. If there is any damage or major spillage, participants should contact a field manager and swap out the device for a new one.

*Chest bands (optional)* should be cleaned by first detaching the sensor box from the blue band. The sensor may be cleaned gently by hand using disinfecting wipes. DO NOT submerge the sensor in water. The blue belt can be washed using gloved hands in soapy water for several minutes to ensure removal of soilage. Run the belt under running tap water until fully rinsed of all detergent. Dry the belt by firmly pressing it with a towel to remove excess water, followed by a complete air dry.


## <a name="mperf"></a>mPerf Study App Overview

Participants will interact with the **mPerf Study app** to perform certain activities such as viewing data quality, pausing data collection, and viewing data such as Step Count or Work Duration.

<img src="/img/howto/mPerf/mPerfStudyIcon.png">

Participants can view the message below in the phone notifications to quickly confirm that data collection is on.

<img src="/img/howto/mPerf/mPerfNotificationON.png">

Participants can view the *Sensor Data Quality* icons in the mPerf app to check data quality. If data quality is poor, troubleshooting tips can be found on the phone by tapping the data quality icons in the app.

If you do not see the mPerf notification, or if it says data collection is off, you can turn data collection on by tapping *Start Data Collection* in the mPerf Study App menu (found in the top-left corner).

#### <a name="dataquality"></a>Sensor Data Quality

Use the Sensor Data Quality icons to determine if your wrist sensors are collecting good data.

<img src="/img/howto/mPerf/mPerfSensorDataQuality.png">

<img src="/img/howto/mPerf/greencheck2.png">

Green checkmark means good data quality.

<img src="/img/howto/mPerf/yellowcaution2.png">

Yellow caution icon means bad data quality.

<img src="/img/howto/mPerf/redX2.png">

Red X means no data is being collected.

If you see a yellow caution icon or a red X icon for an extended period of time, you may tap the icon to view a list of simple troubleshooting options:

1. In the menu (found in the upper-left corner of the app's home screen), tap *Reset Application*, wait 15 seconds and check again.
2. Restart the phone, wait one minute and check again.
3. Make sure the wrist sensor is charged and LED lights are on.
4. If these steps do not fix the problem, please contact a staff member.

You may also tap the *Graph* button to view the wrist sensor data on a plotter in real-time, or tap the *Tutorial* video link to view a video with detailed troubleshooting instructions.

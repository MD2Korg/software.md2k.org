#### <a name="wristsensors"></a>Wrist Sensors

Each participant should wear the wrist sensors for an average of 8 hours a day. The sensors should be worn like a watch on each arm with the charging port pointed away from the hand as shown. The buckle is marked L or R to indicate left wrist or right wrist.

Each participant should carry their phone with them each day and keep the phone charged and powered on.


#### <a name="beacons"></a>Location Beacons

To power the beacons on/off, press down on the top of the beacon like a button. You will see a green LED light flash to indicate power is ON or a red LED light flash to indiciate power is OFF.

The beacon labelled **H** should be placed in the participant's home. The beacon labelled **W** should be placed in the participant's workplace.

Once the  beacons are set in place, they can stay powered ON and remain untouched for the duration of the study. The expected battery life is 3 to 6 months.

## <a name="charge"></a>How to Charge the Hardware

*Wrist sensors* should be charged overnight each day. The expected battery life is approximately 24 hours with a full charge.  

*Location beacons* are battery-powered and do not require charging. The expected battery like is 3-6 months.

*Smartphones* should be charged overnight each day and throughout the day as needed.

*Chest bands (optional)* should be charged overnight each day. The expected battery life is approximately 24 hours with a full charge.

## <a name="clean"></a>How to Clean the Hardware

*Wrist sensors* and *location beacons* can be cleaned gently by hand using disinfecting wipes. DO NOT submerge the devices in water. If there is any damage or major spillage, participants should contact a field manager and swap out the device for a new one.

*Chest bands (optional)* should be cleaned by first detaching the white sensor box from the blue band. The sensor may be cleaned gently by hand using disinfecting wipes. DO NOT submerge the sensor in water. The blue belt can be washed using gloved hands in soapy water for several minutes to ensure removal of soilage. Run the belt under running tap water until fully rinsed of all detergent. Dry the belt by firmly pressing it with a towel to remove excess water, followed by a complete air dry.


## <a name="mperf"></a>mPerf Study App Overview

Participants will interact with the **mPerf Study app** to perform certain activities such as viewing data quality, pausing data collection, and viewing data such as Step Count or Work Duration.

<img src="/img/howto/mPerf/mPerfStudyIcon.png">

Participants can view the message below in the phone notifications to quickly confirm that data collection is on.

<img src="/img/howto/mPerf/mPerfNotificationON.png">

Participants can view the *Sensor Data Quality* icons in the mPerf app to check data quality. If data quality is poor, troubleshooting tips can be found on the phone by tapping the data quality icons in the app.

## <a name="updateapps"></a>How to Install/Update Apps
mCerebrum uses a suite of software applications in conjunction with the main mCerebrum interface app. Follow these steps to download the latest versions of all the apps in your mCerebrum suite.

<center><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/7kaM9G_fxxg" width="560" height="315" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe></center>

1) Tap the icon to open the mCerebrum app.

## <a name="pairwrist"></a>How to Add/Remove a Wrist Sensor

If you need to pair or re-pair a wrist sensor to the phone:

1)	From the main screen of the mCerebrum app, tap *Application Setup*.

2)	Find *MotionSenseHRV* in the list of applications, and tap the *settings/gear icon* under MotionSenseHRV. This will access the Settings screen for the wrist sensors.

**To Remove a Sensor:**

3) On the Settings screen, the paired wrist sensor should automatically appear in the list of Configured Devices. Tap *LEFT_WRIST* or *RIGHT_WRIST* to select the sensor, then tap *Delete* to unpair the sensor from the phone.

**To Add a Sensor:**

3)	On the Settings screen, the wrist sensor you wish to pair should automatically appear in the list of Available Devices as a 12-digit alphanumberic ID. Tap the wrist sensor ID to pair it to the phone.
*Note: If you do not see any IDs listed, make sure the sensor is charged and within range of the phone. If you see multiple IDs listed, try moving to another location so the phone is out of range of any wrist sensors other than the one you are pairing.*

4)	Once you tap the wrist sensor ID, select *Left Wrist* or *Right Wrist* (if unsure, find the L or R letter on the buckle on the wristband).

5)	After selecting left or right placement, the wrist sensor ID should then appear under Configured Devices list to confirm the sensor is paired. Use the back button to return to the app.

# How to Wear/Use the Devices

## Wrist Sensors

Wear the wrist sensors as you would wear a watch or FitBit. The sensors should be worn on each arm so that the charging port is pointed away from your hand as shown. The buckle is marked L or R to indicate left wrist or right wrist. Please be sure to wear each sensor on the correct wrist.

If you are experiencing poor data quality:

- In the menu, tap Reset Application, wait 15 seconds and check again.
- Restart the phone, wait one minute and check again.
- Make sure the wrist sensor is charged and LED lights are on.

## Location Beacons

To power the beacons on/off, press the button in the top center of the location beacon. You will see a green LED light flash to indicate power is ON or a red LED light flash to indiciate power is OFF.

Set the location beacon labelled *Home* anywhere in your home. Set the location beacon labelled *Work* anywhere at your workplace.

Once the location becaons are set in place, they can stay powered ON and remain untouched for the duration of the study. The expected battery life is 3 to 6 months.

## Chest Belt (optional)

You may be asked to wear a chest belt under your clothing for one week during the study. The chest belt records respiration data by monitoring chest movement.

The blue chest band has a buckle that snaps together and holds it to your chest. It can be adjusted to fit your body for a pretty snug fit. To the immediate left and right of the buckle you should see two black ports where the black wires can be plugged in as shown.

# What to Do Each Day

- Wear the wrist sensors
- Confirm the phone is collecting data
- Charge phone and sensors every night

## How to Charge the Devices

At the end of each day, charge all devices overnight (excluding the location beacons, which do not require charging).

Remove the two wrist sensors and plug them into the charger as shown. The charging port can be found on the side of wrist sensor.

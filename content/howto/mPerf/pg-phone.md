## <a name="whattodo"></a>What to Do Each Day

- Wear the wrist sensors and carry the smartphone with you.
- Every 2-3 hours, check to confirm the phone is collecting data.
- Try to wear the sensors during all waking hours, except when there is risk of the sensors getting wet.
- Complete surveys on the phone when prompted.
- Charge phone and wrist sensors every night.

## <a name="wristsensors"></a>Wrist Sensors

#### How to Use

Wear the wrist sensors as you would wear a watch or FitBit. The sensors should be worn on each arm with the charging port pointed away from your hand as shown. The buckle is marked L or R to indicate left wrist or right wrist. Please be sure to wear each sensor on the correct wrist.

If you are experiencing poor data quality:

- In the menu, tap Reset Application, wait 15 seconds and check again.
- Restart the phone, wait one minute and check again.
- Make sure the wrist sensor is charged and LED lights are on.

#### How to Clean

You may clean the wrist sensors gently by hand using disinfecting wipes. DO NOT submerge the wrist sensors in water.

## <a name="beacons"></a>Location Beacons

#### How to Use

To power the beacons on/off, press the button in the top center of the location beacon. You will see a green LED light flash to indicate power is ON or a red LED light flash to indiciate power is OFF.

<img src="/img/howto/mPerf/Beacon2.png">

Set the location beacon labelled *Home* anywhere in your home. Set the location beacon labelled *Work* anywhere at your workplace.

Once the location beacons are set in place, they can stay powered ON and remain untouched for the duration of the study. The expected battery life is 3 to 6 months.

#### How to Clean

You may clean the beacons gently by hand using disinfecting wipes. DO NOT submerge the beacons in water.

## <a name="phoneapp"></a>Phone App

<img src="/img/howto/mPerf/mPerfStudyIcon.png">

#### <a name="dataquality"></a>Sensor Data Quality

Use the Sensor Data Quality icons to determine if your wrist sensors are collecting good data.

<img src="/img/howto/mPerf/mPerfSensorDataQuality.png">

<img src="/img/howto/mPerf/greencheck2.png">

Green checkmark means good data quality.

<img src="/img/howto/mPerf/yellowcaution2.png">

Yellow caution icon means bad data quality.

Red X means no data is being collected.

If you see a yellow caution icon or a red X icon for an extended period of time, you may tap the icon to view a list of simple troubleshooting options:

1. In the menu (found in the upper-left corner of the app's home screen), tap *Reset Application*, wait 15 seconds and check again.
2. Restart the phone, wait one minute and check again.
3. Make sure the wrist sensor is charged and LED lights are on.

## <a name="chestbelt"></a>Chest Belt (optional)

#### How to Use

You may be asked to wear a chest belt under your clothing for one week during the study. The chest belt records respiration data by monitoring chest movement. The blue chest band has a buckle that snaps together and holds it to your chest. It can be adjusted to fit your body for a pretty snug fit.

<img src="/img/howto/mPerf/AutoSenseChest.png">

To the immediate left and right of the buckle you should see two black ports where the black cables can be plugged in. Position the belt so that the backle is at the front of your chest and the cables face down towards your feet as shown above. The other end of the cable should be inserted into the outer-most port on the device.

<img src="/img/howto/mPerf/ASchestRIPplug.png">

#### Troubleshooting

If you are experiencing poor data quality:

- In the menu, tap Reset Application, wait 15 seconds and check again.
- Restart the phone, wait one minute and check again.
- Make sure the wrist sensor is charged.

#### How to Clean

You may clean the chest band gently by hand using disinfecting wipes. DO NOT submerge the chest band in water.


## <a name="charging"></a>How to Charge the Devices

At the end of each day, charge all devices overnight (excluding the location beacons, which do not require charging). Do not force the chargers, look for matching ends and try to connect them carefully since these are delicate devices.

Take off the two wrist sensors and plug them into the charger as shown. The charging port can be found on the side of wrist sensor.


The charging port for the smartphone can be found on the bottom of the phone.


The charging port for the chest band (optional) can be found on the side of the sensor.

# How to Wear/Use the Devices

## Wrist Sensors

Put the wrist sensors on as you would wear a watch or FitBit. The sensors should be worn on each arm so that the charging port is pointed away from your hand as shown.

If you are experiencing poor data quality:

- Close the application, wait 15 seconds, then reopen the application and check again.
- Restart the phone, wait one minute and check again.
- Make sure the wrist sensor is charged.

## Location Beacons

To power the beacons on/off, press the button in the top center of the location beacon. You will see a green LED light flash to indicate power is ON or a red LED light flash to indiciate power is OFF.

Set the location beacon labelled *Home* anywhere in your home. Set the location beacon labelled *Work* anywhere at your workplace.

Once the location becaons are set in place, they can stay powered ON and remain untouched for the duration of the study. The expected battery life is 3 to 6 months.

## Chest Belt (optional)

## What to Do Each Day

- Wear the wrist sensors and carry the smartphone with you.
- Every 2-3 hours, check to confirm the phone is collecting data.
- Try to achieve at least 12 hours of data collection each day.
- Complete surveys on the phone when prompted.
- Charge phone and wrist sensors every night.

## Wrist Sensors

#### How to Use

Wear the wrist sensors as you would wear a watch or FitBit. The sensors should be worn on each arm with the charging port pointed away from your hand as shown. The buckle is marked L or R to indicate left wrist or right wrist. Please be sure to wear each sensor on the correct wrist.

If you are experiencing poor data quality:

- In the menu, tap Reset Application, wait 15 seconds and check again.
- Restart the phone, wait one minute and check again.
- Make sure the wrist sensor is charged and LED lights are on.

#### How to Clean

You may clean the wrist sensors gently by hand using disinfecting wipes. DO NOT submerge the wrist sensors in water.

## Location Beacons

Set the location beacon labelled *Home* anywhere in your home. Set the location beacon labelled *Work* anywhere at your workplace.

Once the location beacons are set in place, they can stay powered ON and remain untouched for the duration of the study. The expected battery life is 3 to 6 months.

#### How to Clean

You may clean the beacons gently by hand using disinfecting wipes. DO NOT submerge the beacons in water.

## Phone App

If you wish to pause data collection for your privacy at any point during the day, tap the pause button.  On the *Privacy Control Settings* screen, tap to set the Privacy Duration (how long data collection will be paused) and Privacy Type (which sensors will be paused). When finished, tap *Start* to pause. Data collection will automatically resume when the time has expired.

## Chest Belt (optional)

#### How to Use

You may be asked to wear a chest belt under your clothing for one week during the study. The chest belt records respiration data by monitoring chest movement. The blue chest band has a buckle that snaps together and holds it to your chest. It can be adjusted to fit your body for a pretty snug fit.

To the immediate left and right of the buckle you should see two black ports where the black cables can be plugged in. Position the belt so that the backle is at the front of your chest and the cables face down towards your feet as shown above. The other end of the cable should be inserted into the outer-most port on the device.

#### Troubleshooting

If you are experiencing poor data quality:

- In the menu, tap Reset Application, wait 15 seconds and check again.
- Restart the phone, wait one minute and check again.
- Make sure the wrist sensor is charged.

#### How to Clean

You may clean the chest band gently by hand using disinfecting wipes. DO NOT submerge the chest band in water.


## How to Charge the Devices

At the end of each day, charge all devices overnight (excluding the location beacons, which do not require charging). Do not force the chargers, look for matching ends and try to connect them carefully since these are delicate devices.

Take off the two wrist sensors and plug them into the charger as shown. The charging port can be found on the side of wrist sensor.


The charging port for the smartphone can be found on the bottom of the phone.


The charging port for the chest band (optional) can be found on the side of the sensor.

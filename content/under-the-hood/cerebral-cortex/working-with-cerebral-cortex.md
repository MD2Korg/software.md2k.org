# Jupyter Notebooks
The main developer interface is based on a customizes Jupyter Notebooks that comes
preinstalled with Apache Spark and Cerebral Cortex.  The following configuration file
and python3 code show how to initialize a Cerebral Cortex instance to begin working
with it.

cerebralcortex.yml
```yaml
cassandra:
  keyspace: cerebralcortex
  db_user: ""
  db_pass: ""
  datapoint_table: data


mysql:
  database: cerebralcortex
  db_user: root
  db_pass: pass
  datastream_table: stream
  processing_module_table: processing_module
  user_table: user
  study_table: study

```

```python3
from cerebralcortex.CerebralCortex import CerebralCortex

configuration_file = 'cerebralcortex.yml'
CC = CerebralCortex(configuration_file, master="local[*]", name="Cerebral Cortex Test App")

```


# Grafana
Grafana provides real-time and historical visualization for most time series-based data streams
generated by mCerebrum or Cerebral Cortex.  These are presented in an easy-to-use graphical
interface that is customizable through a web interface.  Several dashboards come preconfigured to
display common elements that are generated by mCerebrum and can be useful to a health-science researcher.

# Logging
All logging in Docker containers are redirected to an Elastic Search server through fluentd and visualized
by Kibana.  This allows for easy and quick search of log entries and more complex fault analysis through
Kibana's query tooling.
